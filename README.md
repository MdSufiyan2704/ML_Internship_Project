🌲 Forest Fire Detection using Deep Learning
This project was developed during my internship at Edunet Foundation, where I explored Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques to address real-world challenges. The goal of this project is to build an intelligent system that can detect forest fires using image-based data, contributing to early fire warning systems and helping in environmental protection efforts.

🔍 Project Overview
Objective: To detect forest fires from images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

Tech Stack: Python, TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib.

Model: A custom CNN model trained on a labeled dataset of forest fire and non-fire images.

Accuracy: Achieved high classification accuracy on validation and test datasets.

Deployment Ready: The model can be integrated into real-time surveillance systems for fire detection.

🚀 Features
Image classification (Fire vs. No Fire).

Preprocessing pipeline with image resizing and normalization.

Training and evaluation scripts included.

Confusion matrix and performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall).

Easily extendable to multi-class or real-time detection.

📁 Dataset
Used a public dataset consisting of images categorized as:

Fire – images with visible forest fires.

No Fire – safe forest environments.

Data augmentation applied for improving generalization.
